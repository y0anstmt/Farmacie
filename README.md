# Farmacie

In this project, I developed a program with an interface for managing a pharmacy. When the program is run, it offers several features: you can search for a specific medication to check if it's in stock and see the available quantity; you can add an order, which can later be fulfilled; you can view a history of fulfilled orders; and there's also an "Info" option where you can enter keywords like "cardio," "fever," "respiratory," etc., and it will display medications that can help treat those conditions.
This program is built in Java using JavaFX. It was originally a lab assignment during university, but I decided to optimize it and continue developing it further. The program displays error messages if invalid input is provided â€” for example, when placing an order, if you leave a field empty or enter a string instead of a number for the quantity, it will show an error message. Similarly, if you enter a word that doesn't describe a symptom or isn't related to a medical condition, an error will be displayed as well.
